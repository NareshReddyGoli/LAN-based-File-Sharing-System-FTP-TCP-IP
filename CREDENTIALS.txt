LAN File Sharing System — Default Credentials
===============================================

Faculty 1:
  Username : faculty1
  Password : pass123
  Hostname : FACULTY1-PC (localhost for testing)

Faculty 2:
  Username : faculty2
  Password : pass456
  Hostname : FACULTY2-PC

Faculty 3:
  Username : faculty3
  Password : pass789
  Hostname : FACULTY3-PC

Faculty 4:
  Username : faculty4
  Password : pass321
  Hostname : FACULTY4-PC

Faculty 5:
  Username : faculty5
  Password : pass654
  Hostname : FACULTY5-PC

HOW TO ADD MORE FACULTY:
========================
1. Open src\common\SecurityUtil.java
   Add this line in the CREDENTIALS block:
     CREDENTIALS.put("faculty6", hashPassword("yourPassword"));

2. Open src\common\Protocol.java
   Add this line in the HOSTNAMES block:
     HOSTNAMES.put("faculty6", "FACULTY6-PC");

3. Rebuild:
     build.bat

4. Run the new server:
     run_server.bat faculty6

AUTO-DETECT FEATURE:
====================
The server automatically detects the PC's hostname and matches it
to a faculty account. Just double-click StartServer.bat — no need
to select a faculty manually if the hostname is mapped above.

Example: If your PC hostname is "HP", and Protocol.java maps
faculty2 → "HP", the server auto-starts as faculty2.

If the hostname is NOT in the map, the server shows a chooser dialog.

IMPORTANT:
- Passwords are hashed with SHA-256 before transmission.
- Faculty PC hostname MUST match the value in Protocol.java.
- Change "localhost" to actual hostname for production.
